# My Personal Website

A website that includes stuff about me, my current projects, and a bit of contact info.\
Not the best but simple enough.

### Running Instructions

Once you have downloaded the repo, make sure you have NodeJS installed (with the express package) and then run "node app.js" in the root dir to start the server.

You can change the port number by simply changing the value of 'port' in the app.js file.
